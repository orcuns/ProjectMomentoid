UDK Final Project


Started this final project with a group with 4 people. The project is about a 2.5D platformer game named "Project Momentoid" which will be created using the game engine containing the named Unreal Development Kit (UDK). In this popular game programming tool, there are various elements that help implement our game project. UDK has its own assets (graphics, animations and visuals, etc) that we used and manipulate these assets for our purpose. In our project, instead of focusing on visuals and graphics, we are going to focus on unique game play and mechanics which is also achieved using UDK. In conclusion, we would have an Indie game that will offer players a distinctive experience.
We desire to develop is a 2.5D platformer, which means it’s actually 3D but camera is restricted to an angle and UDK gives us capability to do so. Gameplay is going to be focused on environmental challenges like trap doors, spikes etc. That means, physique and moveset of characters will have a crucial role on fun part of the game. Robots will have slots on him and player will try to overcome those difficulties by changing parts of robot, and that would improve playability of game. Using different equipments gives player chance to use his/her creativity and multiple approaches on beating levels. With ability of being able to do some adjustment on robot we would eliminate the possibility of monotonous and linear gameplay. Thus achieving the unique gameplay experience that we aim to offer.
